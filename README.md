A Scala implementation of [Handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com/), an extension to and superset of the [Mustache](http://mustache.github.com/) templating language. Currently implements version [1.0.0](https://github.com/wycats/handlebars.js/tree/1.0.0) of the JavaScript version.

This project began as an attempt to learn Scala and to experiment with Scala's [Parser Combinators](http://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/index.html#scala.util.parsing.combinator.Parsers) in an attempt to get handlebars.js templates working in Scala.

## Installation

If you're using SBT you can add this line to your build.sbt file.

    libraryDependencies += "com.gilt" %% "handlebars-scala" % "2.1.2-SNAPSHOT"

## Usage

Given a template:

    val template = """
      <p>Hello, my name is {{name}}. I am from {{hometown}}. I have {{kids.length}} kids:</p>
      <ul>
        {{#kids}}<li>{{name}} is {{age}}</li>{{/kids}}
      </ul>
    """

And an arbitrary Scala object:

    object Guy {
      val name = "Alan"
      val hometown = "Somewhere, TX"
      val kids = Seq(Map(
        "name" -> "Jimmy",
        "age" -> "12"
      ), Map(
        "name" -> "Sally",
        "age" -> "4"
      ))
    }

Pass those into Handlebars like so:

    scala> import com.gilt.handlebars.scala.binding.dynamic._
    import com.gilt.handlebars.scala.binding.dynamic._

    scala> import com.gilt.handlebars.scala.Handlebars
    import com.gilt.handlebars.scala.Handlebars

    scala> val t = Handlebars(template)
    t: com.gilt.handlebars.scala.Handlebars = com.gilt.handlebars.scala.Handlebars@496d864e

    scala> t(Guy)
    res0: String =
    "
          <p>Hello, my name is Alan. I am from Somewhere, TX. I have 2 kids:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Jimmy is 12</li><li>Sally is 4</li>
          </ul>
        "

Handlebars.scala will work just fine for [Mustache](http://mustache.github.com/mustache.5.html) templates, but includes features such as Paths and Helpers.

The example above demonstrates the `apply` method of a `Handlebars` instance, which should be familiar to Scala-fans. `apply` takes additional optional arguments:

+ `data` additional custom data to be referenced by @variable private variables.
+ `partials` custom partials in addition to the globally defined ones. These partials will override the globally provided ones.
+ `helpers` custom helpers in addition to the globally defined ones. These helpers will override the globally provided ones.

The signature for apply looks like this:

    def apply[T](context: T,
          data: Map[String, Binding[T]] = Map.empty,
          partials: Map[String, Handlebars[T]] = Map.empty,
          helpers: Map[String, Helper[T]] = Map.empty): String

## Bindings

In order to facilitate multiple ways of interacting with data, Handlebars provides a data-binding facility. Handlebars ships with a default binding strategy, DynamicBinding, which uses Scala reflection to work with scala standard-library data structures and primitives. You can implement your own Binding strategies by implementing the following traits:

- `com.gilt.handlebars.scala.binding.FullBinding`
- `com.gilt.handlebars.scala.binding.BindingFactory`

Provide the implicit BindingFactory which uses your new binding. If you need an example, see the source code in `binding/dynamic/DynamicBinding.scala`.

### Binding Interface

+ `def get: T` - Retrieve the contents of the binding. Throws runtime exception if in the void.
+ `def getOrElse(default: => T): T` - Get the contents of the binding if full; else is VoidBinding return default
+ `def toOption: Option[T]` - Similar to the Option constructor, returns Some(value) where value is defined
+ `def render: String` - Returns a string representation for the object, returning empty string where value is not defined.
+ `def traverse(key: String, args: List[Binding[T]] = List.empty): Binding[T]` For dictionaries / objects, traverse into named key, returning a binding for the matched value, VoidBinding if key is not declared.

    Important! Take note of the difference here:

    ```scala
    val binding = DynamicBinding(Map("a" -> null))
    binding.traverse("a") // => DynamicBinding(null)
    binding.traverse("b") // => VoidBinding
    ```

+ `def isTruthy: Boolean` - Returns whether the bound value evaluate to truth in handlebars if expressions?
+ `def isCollection: Boolean` - Returns whether the bound value is an iterable (and not a dictionary)
+ `def isDictionary: Boolean` - Returns whether the bound value is a dictionary
+ `def isPrimitive` - Returns whether bound value is neither collection or dictionary

+ `def asOption: Option[Binding[T]]` - If value is defined, returns Some(this), else None
+ `def asCollection: Iterable[Binding[T]]` - Returns List of bindings if isCollection; else empty List
+ `def asDictionaryCollection: Iterable[(String, Binding[T])]` - returns List of key-value tuples if isDictionary; else empty list

### `Unit` vs `null` vs `None` vs `VoidBinding`

In order to preserve the signal of "a value was defined in your model", vs., "you traversed outside the space covered by your model", bindings are monadic and capture whether they've a value from your model or not: a `FullBinding` if bound against a value from your model, a `VoidBinding` is you traversed outside the space of your model.

If the model contained a `null`, `Unit`, or `None`

`isDefined` is `true` if the bound value is within the space of the model, and it evaluates to some value other than . `VoidBinding` is, naturally, never defined, and always returns `isDefined` as `false`.

### Pattern matching value extraction

You can extract the bound value by matching `FullBinding`, like so:

```scala
DynamicBinding(1) match {
  case FullBinding(value) => value
  case VoidBinding => Unit
}
```

## Helpers

The trait for a helper looks like this:

    trait Helper[Any] {
      def apply(binding: Binding[Any], options: HelperOptions[Any]): String
    }

+ `binding` the binding for the model in the context from which the helper was called.
+ `options` provides helper functions to interact with the context and evaluate the body of the helper, if present.

You can define a new helper by extending the trait above, or you can use companion obejct apply method to define one on the fly:

    val fullNameHelper = Helper[Any] {
      (binding, options) =>
        "%s %s".format(options.lookup("firstName").renderString, options.lookup("lastName").renderString)
    }

If you know that the information you need is on `binding`, you can do the same thing by accessing first and last name on the data directly. However, you will be responsible for casting model to the correct type.

    val fullNameHelper = Helper[Any] {
      (binding, options) =>
        val person = binding.get.asInstanceOf[Person]
        "%s %s".format(person.firstName, person.lastName)
    }

### HelperOptions

The `HelperOption[T]` object gives you the tools you need to get things done in your helper. The primary methods are:

+ `def argument(index: Int): Binding[T]` Retrieve an argument from the list provided to the helper by its index.
+ `def data(key: String): Binding[T]` Retrieve data provided to the Handlebars template by its key.
+ `def visit(binding: Binding[T]): String` Evaluates the body of the helper using a context with the provided binding.
+ `def inverse(binding: Binding[T]): String` Evaluate the inverse of body of the helper using the provided model as a context.
+ `def lookup(path: String): Binding[T]` Look up a value for a path in the the current context. The one in which the helper was called.

## Caveats when using DynamicBinding

**Implicit conversions will not work in a template**. Because Handlebars.scala makes heavy use of reflection. Bummer, I know. This leads me too...

**Handlebars.scala makes heavy use of reflection**. This means that there could be unexpected behavior. Method overloading will behave in bizarre ways. There is likely a performance penalty. I'm not sophisticated enough in the arts of the JVM to know the implications of this.

**Not everything from the JavaScript handlebars is supported**. See [NOTSUPPORTED](NOTSUPPORTED.md) for a list of the unsupported features. There are some things JavaScript can do that simply does not make sense to do in Scala.

### Play-Json integration

If you wish for more type-safety, Handlebars-scala comes with integration for play-json. Using PlayJson AST data structures with handlebars provides identical truthy / collection / traversal behavior that you would find using JavaScript values in handlebars-js.

To use:

    libraryDependencies += "com.gilt" %% "handlebars-scala-play-json" % "2.1.2-SNAPSHOT"

## Thanks

Special thanks to the fine folks working on [Scalate](http://scalate.fusesource.org/) whose Mustache parser was my primary source of inspiration. Tom Dale and Yehuda Katz who inceptioned the idea of writing a Handlebars implementation for the JVM. The UI team at Gilt who insisted on using Handlebars and not Mustache for client-side templating. And finally, the denizens of the Scala 2.9.1 chat room at Gilt for answering my questions with enthusiastic aplomb.

## Build

The project uses [sbt](https://github.com/harrah/xsbt/wiki). Assuming you have sbt you can clone the repo, and run:
